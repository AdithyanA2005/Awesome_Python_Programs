In This file there is the strategy which I have used in the main.py file to find the 'maxNumber' and store it in the variable 'result' 
and
Finding the HCF from the LCM
-----------------------------

let 20, 28 be the two numbers which we want to find the LCM of:-
first we will find the lcm and then using the lcm we will find the hcf

	1. Using the inbuilt function 'max' in python we will find the largest number out of the two numbers which the user had inputed
		numberOne = int(input("Enter the first number"))
		numberTwo = int(input("Enter the second number"))
		maxNumber = max(numberOne, numberTwo)
	
	2. Using 'While loop' we run the condition many times and we will break the condition once we reached the desired section
		while True:	
	
	3. a) Now we will put a if-case to find the LCM; We know that teh LCM(20, 28) is 140 which will be stored in the variable 'maxNumber'
 	   b) Now we will modular divide the 'maxNumber' by the two inputed numbers and on the if case we will check when there value becomes '0'
	   c) After the condition becomes true now we will assign the 'maxNumber' to a variable 'result'
			 if maxNumber % numberTwo == 0 and maxNumber % numberOne == 0:
        		     result = maxNumber
       			     break
	4. The above was how we shoud do after getting the right number; This is what we should do when we dont get that number
	   We are simply increasing the value of 'maxNumber' by '1' each time 
			else:
       			    maxNumber = maxNumber + 1
	   		

Finding the HCF:-
	Let us take the example of the above number itself and find the HCF using the Above LCm
	
	Given:
		number1 = 20
		number2 = 28
		LCM = 140
		HCF = ?

		We know that,
		number1  x  number2 = LCM  x  HCF 
		
		Therefor,
		HCF  =  number1  x  number2
			-------------------
				LCM


		That means,
		HCF  =  20  x  28
			--------
		          140

		     =	560
			---
			140

		 HCF =  5
